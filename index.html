  <h1>Topics in Linear Regression Analysis</h1>
  <p>My name is James and I have a bachelor's degree in math and am currently pursuing my master's</p>
  <p>This site is intended as a useful resource for anyone who wants to learn about linear regression
  analysis and several useful statistics concepts and tools. Through a lot of time spent trying to teach
  myself this material I got frustrated with a lack of resources or clarity in explanation when they
  existed. Therefore, the content on this site is, in general, introduced and explained in a thorough
  way.</p>

  <h1>Regression Analysis and Statistics</h1>
  <p>My name is James and I have a bachelor's degree in math and am currently pursuing my master's.</p>
  
  <p>This site is intended as a useful resource for anyone who wants to learn about linear regression
  analysis and several useful statistics concepts and tools. Through a lot of time spent trying to teach
  myself this material I got frustrated with a lack of resources or clarity in explanation when they
  existed. Therefore, the content on this site is, in general, introduced and explained in a thorough
  way so it can be learned as easily as possible. Note, you will need to have a working understanding
  of linear algebra and multivariable calculus and there are many good resources for both. Below are
  all the things covered on this site with links to the page for each one.</p>

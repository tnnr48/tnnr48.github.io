 <h1>Lindeberg-Levy CLT</h1>
  
  <p>
    The Lindeberg-Levy CLT states that suppose we have some sample of random variables 
    \(X_1, X_2, X_3, \ldots\) drawn from a population, which are independent and 
    identically distributed (the value of one does not change the value of any 
    other and all have the same distribution), with sample mean \(\bar{X_i}\), 
    population mean \(E[X_i] = \mu\), and population variance 
    \(\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = \sigma^2 < \infty\) (finite variance). 
    Then as the sample size \(n\) approaches \(\infty\), the standardized sample means 
    \(\frac{\sqrt{n}(\bar{X} - \mu)}{\sigma}\) converge in distribution to the 
    standard normal distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In other words, the distribution of the sample mean, with samples drawn from some 
    population that has a mean and variance (first and second moments), will be 
    normally distributed for large enough sample size \(n\). To prove the CLT, we 
    consider the sample mean 
    \(\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\) 
    which, on average, is:

      = \tfrac{1}{n} n\mu
